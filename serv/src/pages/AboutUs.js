                    <h2 className='A-Names'>About our project - serv</h2> 
                    <p className='A-disc'>Serv is an original, community-oriented website where students can find & reserve community service opportunities at their school. Educators and officials from schools can post these opportunities on Serv, logging in with Google and listing that community service opportunity at the school of their choice, for students to then reserve & serve — all from the leisure of their homes. Students can view community service opportunities that have been listed by their school’s educators available using the drop-down menu, select the school of their choice, & reserve the spot to serve. This provides a much better experience for all three parties; it eliminates all prior human contact and lets educators scout all types of students. Serv would be managed by an authoritative figure in schools such as, the guidance counselor or the Student Council. To add on, one reliable student may be selected to check Serv every morning and update a bulletin board in high traffic areas around the school. This will provide equal opportunity for students without technology at home. To illustrate, if you attend High Tech High School, and an educator at the Design & Fabrication Academy is in the severe need of volunteers to aid in an initiative — the educator can simply log onto Serv, select High Tech as the school of their choice via the drop-down menu, & list the community service opportunity. From there, a student at High Tech, whether in the need of service hours for graduation or infatuation purposes, can log onto Serv, select High Tech as the school of their choice via the drop-down menu, & can view & reserve that community service opportunity for themselves.
